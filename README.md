# tixy-rpi-led-panel
Running the excellent tixy.land on an LED panel off a Raspberry Pi

## TODO
CLI that allows:

* Go to next  
* Go to random  
* Adjust brightness  
* Set skip interval  
* Set speed  
* Input your own  
* Save your own to a my_functions.json or similar  
* Save to favorites  
* Some way to leave and come back (screen?)  
* Set colors (rainbow would be cool)   
* Set speed / brightness per example  

Fix centering (may be hard) (or do it for individual examples)

~~Fix i variable~~

~~Load up internet_examples~~

~~Fix evaluation, should use with(Math)~~

~~Add npm start script~~

~~Normalize values to -1 -> +1~~
